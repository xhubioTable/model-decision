== Model
The model is the internal representation of a decision table.

All the sections, rows and test cases are stored by IDs.
So the model is not an array of arrays. This is harder to handle when
looking through the code, but the big advantage is when the Model
needs to be manipulated. Add new sections and test cases (row and columns).
Or reordering some elements.
