== Model
The model is the internal representation of a decision table. Rather than using a simple array of arrays, the model organizes all sections, rows, and test cases by unique IDs. This approach may be more complex to follow in the code, but it greatly simplifies operations such as adding new sections or test cases, reordering elements, and manipulating the model dynamically.
