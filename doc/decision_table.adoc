== Layout of an equivalence class table

.Example table
image::images/model-decision/table.jpg[]

This image shows an example for an equivalence class table. The table
is divided in a few sections.

.Test case side

The right side shows the test cases. Each column on the right side is one
test case. The column header of a test case is the name of this test case.
In this example the names are just numbers. Column ''F'' is the first test case with the
name ''1''.


.The field description

The left side of the table describes the fields. And the expected result.

.Field section

On the left side there are two ''field sections'' The most tables have two field sections.
The secondary data section and the primary data section. The primary data is the data
which is directly manipulated in the test. The secondary data is the data constellation
needed by this test.

For example we would like to test a payment where we exceed the day limit. Then we need to specify
secondary data which sets the day limit for a payment.

Each field section is divided in sub sections. For the payment example there is one sub section
for each field in the UI.

The field sections describes the variety of data needed by the test. And so the amount of tests
to be created.

.Field sub section

A sub section in this case is one field and all the equivalence classes for this field.
An equivalence class defines the different kind of field values with an equivalent behaviour.

For example the is a field with a maximum length of 10. Then all values entered with more then
10 chars will lead to an equivalent behaviour of the application. So it is not necessary
to test with 11, 12, 13, ... characters. The equivalent class is 'more than 10 chars'

.Multi row section

The multi row sections could be used to describe the expected results or error messages. It is free to the user
how many of these sections are in the table. It could also contain actions on the UI or other information needed.
