== Sections of an Equivalence Class Table


== FieldSection
The field section is the main section of an equivalence class table. The field section contains
many field sub sections. It is a kind of parenthesis around fields and a grouping of element.

== FieldSubSection
This section contains all the equivalence classes for one single field.

== MultiRowSection
The MultirowSections could be used for your own purpose. These sections are not directly supported by
the test data generator like the field sections. But each data generator has access to the data from the
multi row sections.

== Single Row Sections
Single row sections are sections which have only one row.

=== ExecuteSection

The image shows the execute section. In this example the test case '2' in column
'G' is set to 'F' which is false. So this test case would not be executed.

=== MultiplicitySection

The image shows the multiplicity section. In this example the test case '1' in column
'f' is set to '10'. This means the data generator will create 10 of these test cases.

=== SummarySection

The summary section is not used by the generator. Is only for the user.
